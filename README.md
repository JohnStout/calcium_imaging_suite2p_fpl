# Jupyter-notebooks to support calcium imaging preprocessing with suite2p and visualizations with fastplotlib

The suite2p_run notebook is currently geared towards metadata from Thorlabs equipment, so this would need to be changed accordingly.

Follow these instructions to use (replace env_name with your desired name)

        git clone https://github.com/JohnStout/suite2p_fastplotlib_notebooks
        cd suite2p_fastplotlib_notebooks
        conda env create -n <env_name> -f environment.yml
